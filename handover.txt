Shopping System

This program displays a list of available products from a store's inventory
and allows the user to select items they would like to purchase, along with the
quantity of each item. Once the user has finished their shopping, the program
will print & save a receipt for their transaction.

Running the program:

First you'll need to install the boto3 module using pip:
python3 -m pip install boto3

Then you can run the shopping system with:
python3 shop.py

There will be text prompts that appear immediately after the store's inventory
is displayed, asking you to choose a matching product and a quantity.

showProducts():
- Description: Shows a list of products from our products.dat file.

formatDollar(dollar_value):
- Description: Converts a float into a string and adds a dollar sign into it for easier text alignment.
- Parameters:
    dollar_value - The dollar value as a float

The initial part of the program connects to an S3 bucket to download the product inventory and 
the program's default settings (HST and discount rates). The main program loop continually
prompts the user to choose a product, and then choose a quantity. Once the user is done, they
can quit the loop and will receive a receipt printed onto their screen. The program
also uploads this receipt to the day's collection of receipts.

As a back-end extention, an admin program is contained inside bonus.py which allows store managers
to download all receipts and view daily sale graphs.
Running the bonus.py admin program:

First install the matplotlib module:
python3 -m pip install matplotlib

Then run the bonus program:
python3 bonus.py
