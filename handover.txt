Shopping System

This program displays a list of available products from a store's inventory
and allows the user to select items they would like to purchase, along with the
quantity of each item. Once the user has finished their shopping, the program
will print & save a receipt for their transaction.

To run this program in your terminal, from the program current's directory run this command:
python3 shop.py

There will be text prompts that appear immediately after the store's inventory
is displayed, asking you to choose a matching product and a quantity.

The initial part of the program connects to an S3 bucket to download the product inventory and 
the program's default settings (HST and discount rates). The main program loop continually
prompts the user to choose a product, and then choose a quantity. Once the user is done, they
can quit the loop and will receive a receipt printed onto their screen. The program
also uploads this receipt to the day's collection of receipts.

As a back-end extention, an admin program is contained inside bonus.py which allows store managers
to download all receipts and view daily sale graphs.
